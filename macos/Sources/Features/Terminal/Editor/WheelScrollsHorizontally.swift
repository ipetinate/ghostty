/// only by a trackpad swipe. Every editor with a scrolling tab strip answers
/// the plain wheel there, because it is the fast way to get to a tab.
///
/// **Scoped on purpose.** The monitor is process-wide — that is the only place
/// AppKit lets a view see a wheel event it is not the target of — so it
/// answers only when all four of these hold: the scroll view is in the event's
/// own window, the pointer is inside its bounds, the gesture is vertical, and
/// the content is actually wider than the viewport. Anything else is returned
/// untouched and reaches whatever scroll view it was meant for. Without those
/// guards this would quietly turn every vertical scroll in the app sideways.
